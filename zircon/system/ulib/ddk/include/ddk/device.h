//@ # The Device Protocol
//
// Device drivers implement a set of hooks (methods) to support the
// operations that may be done on the devices that they publish.
//
// These are described below, including the action that is taken
// by the default implementation that is used for each hook if the
// driver does not provide its own implementation.

typedef struct zx_protocol_device {
  //@ ## version
  // This field must be set to `DEVICE_OPS_VERSION`
  uint64_t version;

  //@ ## get_protocol
  // The get_protocol hook is called when a driver invokes
  // **device_get_protocol()** on a device object.  The implementation must
  // populate *protocol* with a protocol structure determined by *proto_id*.
  // If the requested *proto_id* is not supported, the implementation must
  // return ZX_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED.
  //
  // The default get_protocol hook returns with *protocol*=*proto_ops* if *proto_id*
  // matches the one given when **device_add()** created the device, and returns
  // ZX_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED otherwise.
  //
  // See the **device_get_protocol()** docs for a description of the layout of
  // *protocol*.
  //
  // This hook is never called by the devhost runtime other than when
  // **device_get_protocol()** is invoked by some driver.  It is executed
  // synchronously in the same thread as the caller.
  zx_status_t (*get_protocol)(void* ctx, uint32_t proto_id, void* protocol);

  //@ ## open_protocol_session_multibindable
  // The open_protocol_session_multibindable hook is called when the component driver invokes
  // **device_open_protocol_session_multibindable()** on a device object that supports multibinding.
  // A driver that supports multibinding, may choose to implement this hook, if it needs to know
  // which composite device is making the protocol ops it requested.
  //
  // The implementation must populate *protocol* with
  // a protocol structure determined by *proto_id* and a protocol context that is unique to this
  // session. If the requested *proto_id* is not supported, the implementation must return
  // ZX_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED.
  //
  //
  // See the **device_open_protocol_session_multibindable()** docs for a description of the layout
  // of *protocol*.
  //
  // This hook is never called by the devhost runtime other than when
  // **device_open_protocol_session_multibindable()** is invoked by component driver. It is executed
  // synchronously in the same thread as the caller.
  zx_status_t (*open_protocol_session_multibindable)(void* ctx, uint32_t proto_id, void* protocol);
  //@ ## close_protocol_session_multibindable
  // The close_protocol_session_multibindable hook is called when the component driver invokes
  // **device_close_protocol_session_multibindable()** on a device object that supports
  // multibinding. A driver that supports multibinding, may choose to implement this hook along with
  // open_protocol_session_multibindable, if it needs to know which composite device is making the
  // protocol ops it requested.
  //
  // The implementation must identify the context passed and close the corresponding
  // session.
  //
  // This hook is never called by the devhost runtime other than when
  // **device_close_protocol_session_multibindable()** is invoked by component driver. It is
  // executed synchronously in the same thread as the caller.
  zx_status_t (*close_protocol_session_multibindable)(void* ctx, void* protocol);
  //@ ## init
  // The init hook is called when a device is initially added.
  //
  // If implemented, the device is guaranteed to not be unbound before the driver
  // calls **device_init_reply()** on itself. This allows drivers to safely complete
  // initialization without explicit synchronization with the unbind hook,
  // such as adding device metadata or spawning a worker thread.
  //
  // The hook is always called from the devhost's main thread.
  void (*init)(void* ctx);

  //@ ## open
  // The open hook is called when a device is opened via the device filesystem,
  // or when an existing open connection to a device is cloned (for example,
  // when a device fd is shared with another process).  The default open hook,
  // if a driver does not implement one, simply returns **ZX_OK**.
  //
  // Drivers may want to implement open to disallow simultaneous access (by
  // failing if the device is already open), or to return a new **device instance**
  // instead.
  //
  // The optional *dev_out* parameter allows a device to create and return a
  // **device instance** child device, which can be used to manage per-instance
  // state instead of all client connections interacting with the device itself.
  // A child created for return as an instance **must** be created with the
  // **DEVICE_ADD_INSTANCE** flag set in the arguments to **device_add()**.
  //
  // This hook is almost always called from the devhost's main thread.  The
  // one exception is if **device_add()** is invoked with *client_remote* provided and
  // the neither **DEVICE_ADD_MUST_ISOLATE** nor **DEVICE_ADD_INVISIBLE** were
  // provided, in which case this hook will be executed synchronously from the thread
  // that invoked **device_add()**, before **device_add()** returns.
  // DO NOT rely on that exception being true.  The implementation may in the
  // future push all invocations to the main thread.
  zx_status_t (*open)(void* ctx, zx_device_t** dev_out, uint32_t flags);

  //@ ## close
  // The close hook is called when a connection to a device is closed. These
  // calls will balance the calls to open.
  //
  // **Note:** If open returns a **device instance**, the balancing close hook
  // that is called is the close hook on the **instance**, not the parent.
  //
  // The default close implementation returns **ZX_OK**.
  //
  // This hook is almost always called from the devhost's main thread.  The one
  // exception is in the same situation as for the open hook described
  // above, in which the close hook may run to handle certain failure conditions
  // after the open hook ran.
  zx_status_t (*close)(void* ctx, uint32_t flags);

  //@ ## unbind
  // The unbind hook is called to begin removal of a device (due to hot unplug, fatal error, etc).
  //
  // The driver should avoid further method calls to its parent device or any
  // protocols obtained from that device, and expect that any further such calls
  // will return with an error.
  //
  // The driver should adjust its state to encourage its client connections to close
  // (cause IO to error out, etc), and call **device_unbind_reply()** on itself when ready.
  // See the docs for **device_unbind_reply()** for important semantics.
  //
  // The driver must continue to handle all device hooks until the **release** hook
  // is invoked.
  //
  // **Note:** This hook will not be called for a **device instance**.
  //
  // This is an optional hook. The default implementation will be a hook that replies
  // immediately with **device_unbind_reply()**.
  //
  // This hook will be called from the devhost's main thread. It will be executed sometime
  // after any of the following events occuring: **device_async_remove()** is invoked on the
  // device, the device's parent has completed its unbind hook via **device_unbind_reply**,
  // or a fuchsia.device.Controller/ScheduleUnbind request is received.
  void (*unbind)(void* ctx);

  //@ ## release
  // The release hook is called after this device has finished unbinding, all open client
  // connections of the device have been closed, and all child devices have been unbound and
  // released.
  //
  // At the point release is invoked, the driver will not receive any further calls
  // and absolutely must not use the underlying **zx_device_t** or any protocols obtained
  // from that device once this method returns.
  //
  // The driver must free all memory and release all resources related to this device
  // before returning.
  //
  // This hook may be called from any thread including the devhost's main
  // thread.
  void (*release)(void* ctx);

  //@ ## read
  // DEPRECATED: DO NOT ADD NEW USES
  //
  // The read hook is an attempt to do a non-blocking read operation.
  //
  // On success *actual* must be set to the number of bytes read (which may be less
  // than the number requested in *count*), and return **ZX_OK**.
  //
  // A successful read of 0 bytes is generally treated as an End Of File notification
  // by clients.
  //
  // If no data is available now, **ZX_ERR_SHOULD_WAIT** must be returned and when
  // data becomes available `device_state_set(DEVICE_STATE_READABLE)` may be used to
  // signal waiting clients.
  //
  // This hook **must not block**.
  //
  // The default read implementation returns **ZX_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED**.
  //
  // This hook will only be executed on the devhost's main thread.
  zx_status_t (*read)(void* ctx, void* buf, size_t count, zx_off_t off, size_t* actual);

  //@ ## write
  // DEPRECATED: DO NOT ADD NEW USES
  //
  // The write hook is an attempt to do a non-blocking write operation.
  //
  // On success *actual* must be set to the number of bytes written (which may be
  // less than the number requested in *count*), and **ZX_OK** should be returned.
  //
  // If it is not possible to write data at present **ZX_ERR_SHOULD_WAIT** must
  // be returned and when it is again possible to write,
  // `device_state_set(DEVICE_STATE_WRITABLE)` may be used to signal waiting clients.
  //
  // This hook **must not block**.
  //
  // The default write implementation returns **ZX_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED**.
  //
  // This hook will only be executed on the devhost's main thread.
  zx_status_t (*write)(void* ctx, const void* buf, size_t count, zx_off_t off, size_t* actual);

  //@ ## get_size
  // DEPRECATED: DO NOT ADD NEW USES
  //
  // If the device is seekable, the get_size hook should return the size of the device.
  //
  // This is the offset at which no more reads or writes are possible.
  //
  // The default implementation returns 0.
  //
  // This hook may be executed on any thread, including the devhost's main
  // thread.
  zx_off_t (*get_size)(void* ctx);

  //@ ## suspend_new
  // The suspend_new hook is used for suspending a device from a working to
  // non-working low power state(sleep state), or from a non-working sleep state
  // to a deeper sleep state.
  //
  // requested_state is always a non-working sleep state.
  // enable_wake is whether to configure the device for wakeup from the requested non
  // working sleep state. If enable_wake is true and the device does not support
  // wake up, the hook fails without suspending the device.
  // suspend_reason provides information for the driver why the suspend hook is called.
  // Bus drivers and platform drivers like acpi will find this information useful to
  // issue any system calls or save the reboot reason.
  //
  // The driver should put the device into the requested_state and call **device_suspend_reply()**
  // on itself. device_suspend_reply() will take in two parameters: status of the suspend operation
  // and an out_state. If status is success, the out_state is same as requested_state.
  // If status is failure, out_state is the low power state the device is currently in.
  //
  // This hook assumes that the drivers are aware of their current state. This hook will only
  // be executed on the devhost's main thread.
  //
  // TODO(ravoorir): Remove the old suspend when all the drivers are moved to
  // new suspend and rename suspend_new to suspend.
  void (*suspend_new)(void* ctx, uint8_t requested_state, bool enable_wake, uint8_t suspend_reason);

  //@ ## resume_new
  // The resume_new hook is used for resuming a device from a non-working sleep
  // state to a working state. It requires reinitializing the device completely
  // or partially depending on the sleep state that device was in, when the
  // resume call was made.
  //
  // requested_state is the performance state that the device has to be in.
  //
  // The driver should put the device into the requested_state and call **device_resume_reply()**
  // on itself. device_resume_reply() will take in the following parameters:
  // (1)Status of the resume operation (2)out_power_state (3) out_perf_state
  // On success, the device has been resumed successfully to a working state,
  // out_perf_state is same as requested state.
  // If the device is not able to resume to a working state, the hook returns a
  // failure. out_power_state has the non working state the device is in.
  // if out_power_state is a working state, out_perf_state has the performance
  // state the device is in.
  // This hook assumes that the drivers are aware of their current state.
  //
  // This hook will only be executed on the devhost's main thread.
  void (*resume_new)(void* ctx, uint32_t requested_state);

  //@ ## set_performance_state
  // The set_performance_state hook is used for transitioning the performant state of
  // a device.
  //
  // requested_state is always a working performant state that is published during
  // device_add.
  //
  // On success, the out_state is same as the requested_state. If the device is in working state,
  // the transition is made immediately.
  // On failure, the out_state is the performance state the device is currently in.
  // If the device is not in working state, driver will return ZX_ERR_UNAVAILABLE and out_state will
  // be fully working performance state.
  //
  // This hook assumes that the drivers are aware of their current sleep state and current
  // performance state.
  //
  // This hook will only be executed on the devhost's main thread.
  //
  zx_status_t (*set_performance_state)(void* ctx, uint32_t requested_state, uint32_t* out_state);

  //@ ## configure_autosuspend
  // The configure_autosuspend hook is used for configuring whether a driver can
  // auto suspend the device depending on the activity and idleness of the device.
  //
  // If "enable" is true, auto suspend is configured. deepest_sleep_state is the deepest
  // sleep state the device is expected to go into when the device is suspended.
  //
  // On success, the device is configured to be autosuspended
  // On failure, the device not configured to be autosuspended. If the device does
  // not implement the autosuspend hook, it means the device does not support autosuspend.
  //
  // This hook will only be executed on the devhost's main thread.
  //

  zx_status_t (*configure_auto_suspend)(void* ctx, bool enable, uint8_t deepest_sleep_state);

  //@ ## rxrpc
  // Only called for bus devices.
  // When the "shadow" of a busdev sends an rpc message, the
  // device that is shadowing is notified by the rxrpc op and
  // should attempt to read and respond to a single message on
  // the provided channel.
  //
  // Any error return from this method will result in the channel
  // being closed and the remote "shadow" losing its connection.
  //
  // This method is called with ZX_HANDLE_INVALID for the channel
  // when a new client connects -- at which point any state from
  // the previous client should be torn down.
